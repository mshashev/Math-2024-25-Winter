1)The line passes through point $A(1, 2)$ and is parallel to the line $y = 2x + 3$. Find the equation of the line.

1. Find the slope (m):

$y-y_1=m\cdot(x-x_1),\quad y-2=1\cdot(x-1), \quad y=x+1$

2)The line passes through point $A(1, 2)$ and is parallel to the line $y = 2x + 3$. Find the equation of the line.

Since the lines are parallel, they have the same slope.

$m=2 \quad\Rightarrow \quad y-y_1=m\cdot(x-x_1),\quad y-2=2\cdot(x-1), \quad y=2x-2+2,\quad y=2x$

3)The line passes through point $A(1, 2)$ and is perpendicular to the line $y = 2x + 3$. Find the equation of the line.

Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.

$m=2\;(as\;we\;want\;to\;find\;the\;perpendicular)\quad\Rightarrow\quad m=-\frac{1}{2}$

$y-y_1=m\cdot(x-x_1),\quad y-2=-\frac{1}{2}\cdot(x-1)|\cdot2,\quad 2y-4=-1\cdot(x-1),\quad 2y=-x+1+4,\quad x+2y=5$

4)We have two lines $y = 2x + 3$ and $y = 3x + 2$. Find the intersection point of these lines and calculate the angle between them.

Find the intersection point of these lines and calculate the angle between them.

To find the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations:

$\begin{cases}y=2x+3\\y=3x+2\end{cases} let's equate \quad\Rightarrow\quad2x+3=3x+2\quad\Rightarrow\quad1=x\quad\Rightarrow\quad x=1 $

$y=2\cdot 1 +3\quad\Rightarrow\quad y=5\quad\Rightarrow\quad$

$intersection(1,5)$

$m_1=2 \qquad m_2=3 $

$\tan\gamma=|{\frac{m_2-m_1}{1+m_1\cdot m_2}}|=|\frac{3-2}{1+2\cdot3}|=|\frac{1}{7}|=\frac{1}{7} \arctan(\frac{1}{7})=8.13^0$
