The line passes through points
А
(
1
,
2
)
 and
Б
(
3
,
4
)
. Find the equation of the line.

1. Find the slope (m):

$y-y_1=m\cdot(x-x_1),\quad y-2=1\cdot(x-1), \quad y=x+1$

#$2)$
The line passes through point
А
(
1
,
2
)
 and is parallel to the line
y
=
2
x
+
3
. Find the equation of the line

Since the lines are parallel, they have the same slope.

$m=2 \quad\Rightarrow \quad y-y_1=m\cdot(x-x_1),\quad y-2=2\cdot(x-1), \quad y=2x-2+2,\quad$
#$y=2x$




#$3)$

The line passes through point
А
(
1
,
2
)
 and is perpendicular to the line
y
=
2
x
+
3
. Find the equation of the line.

Perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals of each other.

$m=2\;(as\;we\;want\;to\;find\;the\;perpendicular)\quad\Rightarrow\quad m=-\frac{1}{2}$

$y-y_1=m\cdot(x-x_1),\quad y-2=-\frac{1}{2}\cdot(x-1)|\cdot2,\quad 2y-4=-1\cdot(x-1),\quad 2y=-x+1+4,\quad$
#$x+2y=5$




#$4)$

We have two lines
y
=
2
x
+
3
 and
y
=
3
x
+
2
. Find the intersection point of these lines and calculate the angle between them.

To find the intersection point, we need to solve the system of equations:

$\begin{cases}y=2x+3 \\ y=3x+2\end{cases} let's\;equate \quad\Rightarrow\quad2x+3=3x+2\quad\Rightarrow\quad1=x\quad\Rightarrow\quad$
##$x=1 $
$y=2\cdot 1 +3\quad\Rightarrow\quad y=5\quad\Rightarrow\quad$
###$intersection(1,5)$

$m_1=2\\m_2=3 $

$\tan\gamma=|{\frac{m_2-m_1}{1+m_1\cdot m_2}}|=|\frac{3-2}{1+2\cdot3}|=|\frac{1}{7}|=\frac{1}{7}$

###$\arctan(\frac{1}{7})=8.13^0$

А
(
1
,

)
 and parallel to the vector
v
→
=
[
2
,
3
]
.

1. Find the slope of the line:

$m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{3}{2}=1.5$

$y-y_1=m\cdot(x-x_1),\quad y-2=1.5(x-1), \quad y=1.5x-1.5+2,$
###$\quad y=1.5x+0.5$




#$6)$

We have the line
y
=
2
x
+
3
. Find an example of a line perpendicular and parallel to it.


Parallel line has the same slope:
###$y=2x+7$

perpendicular has a negative reciprocal slope:

$m=-\frac{1}{2}\\$

###$y=-\frac{1}{2}\cdot x -4$


#$7)$

We have the line
y
=
2
x
+
3
 and point
А
(
1
,
2
)
. Find the distance from point
А
 to the line.

 $Distance\;=\frac{|Ax+By+C|}{\sqrt{A^2+B^2}} where\;|Ax+By+C|\;is\;the\;equation\;of\;the\;line$

 $y=2x-3,\quad -2x+y-3=0, A=-2,\quad B=1\quad C=-3$

 $Distance\;=\frac{|-2\cdot1+1\cdot2+(-3)|}{\sqrt{-2^2+1^2}}=\frac{|-2+2-3|}{\sqrt{5}}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{5}}=$

##$=\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}$



#$8)$

The line intersects the coordinate axes at points
А
(
2
,
0
)
 and
Б
(
0
,
3
)
. Find the equation of the line.

###$\frac{x}{a}+\frac{y}{b}=1$

The line intersects the x-axis at A(2, 0), meaning the x-intercept is 2.
The line intersects the y-axis at B(0, 3), meaning the y-intercept is 3.

###$\frac{x}{2}+\frac{y}{3}=1$


#$9)$

Calculate the angle between the line
у
=
х
+
3
 and the
Оx

 axis.


 The slope of the line y = x + 3 is 1. The slope represents the tangent of the angle the line makes with the positive x-axis.

Therefore, we can use the arctangent function to find the angle:

###$\arctan(1)=45^0$


#$10)$

Provide a vector perpendicular to the line
x
+
y
+
1
=
0
.

perpendicular has a negative reciprocal slope:

$m=-\frac{1}{1}=-1\quad\Rightarrow\quad -x-y+1=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad y=x-1 $
